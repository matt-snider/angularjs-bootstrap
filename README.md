# angularjs-bootstrap

A [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) based component library for [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/). 

**NOTE**: this is a work in progress and there is currently no npm distribution 

## Development
* Install via `npm install`
* Start docs in a webpack dev server with `npm start` (this is a good way to interactively build/change new components)
